Run g++ -o m ChickensandWolves.cpp. The program will ask for a start state
(start1.txt...) and then ask for a goal state (goal1.txt...).  Then it will
ask what type of search algorithm you would like to run (BFS, DFS, IDDFS). 
I was not able to get ASTAR search to work with my program. Every state 
visited along with the number of nodes expanded and nodes in the solution
should be printed on the screen.
